# Robin Collins Final Landmark Assignment Django Full Stack

## The Horseshoe Inn

# Project Purpose

### This is a real pub my friend Paul and his partner Toni purchased in July 2020 amid a pandemic
This is a genuine requested website and will be used once submitted for assement and I am aware
that I will require to use a branch should any urgent updates be required.

With all the drama good and bad, Paul and Toni have experienced along the way, they have gained media attention
from Channel 5 who are now making a documentary of the pub. Paul and I had discussed could 
potentially give my career some exposure also. 

I therefore need to call on all my strengths and work hard on my weakness in delivering a high scoring assignment 
that I can and more importantly my friend can use to benifit and take a lot of hard work out of his business.

If the documentary proves popular The Horseshoe Inn will require a fresh and inviting website that is not over
complicated and easy to navigate with a secure but easy booking system.

The hospitallity industry has suffered like many in 2020 and needs a boost. It will also have key Information
of updates to current rules and regulating and a website with social media links where immediate update are not
possible on the website.

I'd like to think that this website is helping a commuinty and repair the tourism and hospitallity sector that has suffered
possibly irreparable damage in 2020 in the UK with thousands of closures and job losses.

Additional information such as a Menu page and what to do in the area may appeal to visitor to stay longer benefiting
the establishment.

Early cancellation will be refunded with bookings cancelled within 48 hours will lose a deposit and 24 hours full amount.


# UX design

A room booking system is the main requirement, with easy date select and checkout with the option to add extras
for instance breakfast. By having the option to register will allow the Inn to have a database of guests. therefore
with a checkbox on registration they can recieve quarterly/monthly news letters or be informed of last minute room
availability.
