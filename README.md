# Robin Collins Final Landmark Assignment Django Full Stack

## The Horseshoe Inn

# Project Purpose

### This is a real pub my friend Paul and his partner Toni purchased in July 2020 amid a pandemic
This is a genuine requested website and will be used once submitted for assement and I am aware
that I will require to use a branch should any urgent updates be required.

With all the drama good and bad, Paul and Toni have experienced along the way, they have gained media attention
from Channel 5 who are now making a documentary of the pub. Paul and I had discussed this landmark assignment could 
potentially give my career some exposure at the same time freeing his time on people wanting to book rooms and view
constantly updated menu items. 

I therefore need to call on all my strengths and work hard on my weakness in delivering a high scoring assignment 
that I can and just as importantly provide to my my friends that can use to benifit and take a lot of valuable time out of their business.

If the documentary proves popular The Horseshoe Inn will require a fresh and inviting website that is not over
complicated and easy to navigate with a secure but easy booking system. Which provides a secure account to the customer
to update their booking. Obviously I have to also protect the client aswell as a late cancellation will cause finacial issues
so deposits of percentage of costs will have to be deducted from late cancellations for example. I also have to be aware
of stock control as there is only 5 rooms and self catering out building that requires to only be available once during
a day between for instance 2pm until 10:30pm the following day.

The Additional information such as a Menu page and what to do in the area may appeal to visitor to stay longer benefiting
the establishment.

As you are aware the hospitallity industry has suffered like many individuals and businessess in 2020 and needs a boost. 
With the issues of 2020 this will also require and have key Information of updates to current rules and regulating and a website with social media links where immediate update are not
possible on the website.

I'd like to think that this website is helping a commuinty and repair the tourism and hospitallity sector that has suffered
possibly irreparable damage in 2020 in the UK with thousands of closures and job losses.

Early cancellation will be refunded with bookings cancelled within 48 hours will lose a deposit and 24 hours full amount.


# UX design

A room booking system is the main requirement, with easy date select and checkout with the option to add extras
for instance breakfast. By having the option to register will allow the Inn to have a database of guests. therefore
with a checkbox on registration they can recieve quarterly/monthly news letters or be informed of last minute room
availability.

# User Stories

## Usability and Visual Impact:

# Suitability for purpose

# Navigation

# Ease of use

# Information Architecture

# Defensive Design

THE TESTING TO CATCH ISSUES

## Layout and Visual Impact:

# Responsive Design

I have as required taken the mobile first approach as required and a common practise in all assignments throughout my course.
I have relied on the bootstrap technologies to achieve this.

# Image Presentation

# Colour scheme and typography

Using google fonts and my fonts dot com. I used a picture of the front of the inn to identify
what their pub font is and the closest match that was free was Libre Baskerville.
<!-- Don't forget to add visual colour images here and remove this comment when completed-->
This will keep continuity with the establishmennt and to continue with the continuity I have
gone with their new green iterior colour scheme which is #B6D7A8 the font colour for the logo font
is B2B2AB I picked this colour as a colour match from photoshop from the picture with the font.
This colour is subject to change as the image give the impression its a soft gold but I have a grey
green look. This could be due to the current low resolution of the images. I will look again when I
take photographs later this month. What does concern me later is the possible adverse weather conditions 
to bring out the best lights but this has never been an issue before.

Orginally as to familiarise myself with this assignment I am using the code institude Boutique Ado education
videos to guide men through the process and I did think the black and white colours for Font ands banners went 
extremely well with the colours of the front of the pub and I didn't want to change them but glad I did as 
the softer tones feel more inviting and a lot more relaxed and in keeping with the lushious scenery and countryside
surrounding the Horseshoe Inn. It featured in my choices when discussing this project with my client in July and
it was in my mock up styles and what is evenmore impressive my client painted a lot of there interior with the same
colour so for continuity reasons it would be silly not to match this.

# Comments and Diary

In the early stages of development I was having linking issues with the Readme file. Basically I wanted
the best assignment possible with the best readme therefore wanted to add images to the readme rather
than have them stored in a Wireframes folder. I had been shown how impressive some of these files are
and it left me inspired.

It is something I hadn't learned on the course so decided to research into this and successfully found
videos of this on YouTube. However I think the video was slightly dated and got a few errors with the
links not working correctly and I decided to edit within Github rather than GitPod. This was something
I hadn't done before so I did make 2 or 3 commit errors by not adding a coment in the box at the bottom
of the page and the preview option until my 4th attempt.

I contacted tutor support as concerned these errors would go against me hence I am documenting them
now to make the assor aware of my errors which I can say have now been resolved. Despite all of this I
found it a great learning curb as worked out alternate ways to update and alter using git commands and
editing from Github directly.

In week two of development my friend sent me images of The Horseshoe Inn since it had been refurbished
however these images I recieved were very small images suitable for smaller devices but not the large
screens. However, due to his workload he has been unable to get the images to me and further deadlines
get missed due to how busy he is that after a week I have decided to continue with image placers that
fill the gaps until he has time to fullfil my request. I am due to visit in late October 2020 but feel that
this assignment needs to be completed before then as good practise for the industy.

Furthermore, while working on this assignment I have also undertook the task of building another Django 
website for another customer my niece for her vegan cake shop Vixen's Vegan Delights. I did this as I 
knew the amount of pressure my friend is under buying a pub during a pandemic and making it work knowing 
potentially it could go very wrong. To assist him I have plenty of ideas to support him on the way to his
and my successes.

I have found out my deadlines and after a chat with my mentor he has advised me not to take on the huge
task of simoutaniously building 2 large websites as just one was pointed out to me by student services as
a behemoth. I have also been in contact with Paul again at The Horseshoe Inn and he agrees that the
work load for both of us is vast. This project will remain the priority and I will continue with 
Vixen's Vegan Delights after I am closer in completing this assignment.
Furthermore, I am due to travel back to Scotland for further meetings and include terms and conditions
and take proffessional pictures of the establishment. My cut off day for the assignment is 16th December
however, I hope to submit the assignemt around the 1st November to allow me to assist other customers 
and clients I have gathered.

03/11/20
With the delay in images I took a trip to Scotland to get these images while Scotlands hospitality industry
had been closed to public houses. However there was issues with gettting these images as Paul and Toni decided
to decorate the rooms for letting. Therefore what I went therefore I could not achieve. I wont lie I was disapointed
and possible angry as this has proven expensive and time consuming and then being overwhelmed with guilt as could have
attended my auntie and God Mothers funeral. I have to live with these decisions furthermore, I do understand Paul 
and Toni's reasoning but maybe a little communication on their behalf would have helped us both achiving our desired 
goals or not.
Prior to all these the Website meeting we had went really well but they decided they want a darker green colour
for the website. I had already decided that the green colour already being used wouldnt work for smaller devices
and will therefore see where I can improve this but first I need to fix the functionality of the website first.
